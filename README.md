# hello-world
This repository contains my progress with learning how to use Github.
<br>
So here, I'm supposed to write a bit about myself. I'm 25 years old, and I'm hoping to switch from the healthcare field to the tech field. I made this Github account late January and was attempting the Odin Project, but got lost somewhere with the SSH key section. Since then, I've been committing myself to doing freeCodeCamp's curriculum, while dissecting various CodePen codes/designs and YouTube tutorials using frontend languages.

# hello-world
This repository contains my progress with freeCodeCamp's full stack curriculum, while learning how to use Github. Regarding my fCC progress, however, I currently plan on doing the first four courses; (New) Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, Front End Development Libraries, and Data Visualization.

So here, I'm supposed to write a bit about myself. I'm 25 years old, and I'm switching from the healthcare field to the tech field. I made this Github account late January and was attempting the Odin Project, but got lost somewhere with the SSH key section. Since then, I've been committing myself to doing freeCodeCamp's curriculum, while dissecting various CodePen codes/designs and YouTube tutorials using frontend languages.

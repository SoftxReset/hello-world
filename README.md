# hello-world
This repository contains my progress with freeCodeCamp's full stack curriculum, while learning how to use Github. Regarding my fCC progress, however, I currently plan on doing the first four courses; (New) Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, Front End Development Libraries, and Data Visualization.
